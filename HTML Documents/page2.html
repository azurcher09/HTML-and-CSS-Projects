	<h2><center>The Emperor</center></h2>

		<center>
			<p>In Warhammer 40,000, humanity is led by the immortal God-Emperor of Mankind.  He sits upon the Golden Throne, and guides humanity by the strength of his psychic might.
			</p>
			<p>The Golden Throne keeps The Emperor in a state of undeath, having been struck down by his favored son Horus, who had turned traitor in a cataclysmic civil war known as the Horus Heresy 10,000 years before the current setting.
